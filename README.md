# COVID-19 Detection in Blood Exams
Binary classification task for COVID-19 detection in blood exams.

## Description
This work aims to implement a binary classifier to detect COVID-19 infections in blood test samples through the investigation of different machine learning and deep learning techniques. Specifically, this project shows the results of the final experiments conducted on the following classifiers:
- **SVM**
- **Random Forest**
- **Custom Artificial Neural Network**

## Dataset
The dataset adopted for this project was initially released for a competition entitled *COVID19 Detection in Blood Exams*. More details can be found [here](https://hilab.com.br/competition/).
